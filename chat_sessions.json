Details: \"[{'domain': 'global', 'reason': 'badRequest', 'message': 'Bad Request'}]\">\n```\n\nThis means that the request you made to the Google Calendar API had a problem and was not formatted correctly. Here are some potential reasons and solutions:\n\n---\n\n### Possible Issues and Solutions\n\n#### 1. **Invalid `timeMin` or `timeMax` Format**\n- **Problem:** The `timeMin` and `timeMax` values must include a valid time **and** timezone offset or end with a 'Z' if in UTC. For example, `\"2026-01-06T00:00:00+05:30\"` or `\"2026-01-06T00:00:00Z\"`.\n- **Solution:**  \n    - Use: `\"2026-01-06T00:00:00+05:30\"` (for Asia/Kolkata)\n    - Or: `\"2026-01-06T00:00:00Z\"`\n\n#### 2. **Incorrect Query Parameters**\n- Double-check that all parameters are correct and supported by the endpoint.\n    - `q=meeting` is okay for keyword search.\n    - `singleEvents=true`, `orderBy=startTime`, `timeZone=Asia/Kolkata` are supported.\n\n#### 3. **Malformed URL or JSON**\n- If you're manually constructing the request, ensure it is properly URL-encoded.\n\n#### 4. **API Key or Authentication Problems**\n- Make sure your authentication token or API key is valid and has access rights.\n\n#### 5. **Resource Availability**\n- Ensure that the calendar you're referencing (`primary` in this case) exists and is accessible.\n\n---\n\n### Example of Corrected Request\n\n#### REST Example\n\n```http\nGET https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/primary/events\n?timeMin=2026-01-06T00:00:00+05:30\n&timeMax=2026-01-06T23:59:59+05:30\n&q=meeting\n&singleEvents=true\n&orderBy=startTime\n&timeZone=Asia/Kolkata\n```\n\n#### Python Code Sample (using `google-api-python-client`):\n\n```python\nevents_result = service.events().list(\n    calendarId='primary',\n    timeMin='2026-01-06T00:00:00+05:30',\n    timeMax='2026-01-06T23:59:59+05:30',\n    q='meeting',\n    singleEvents=True,\n    orderBy='startTime',\n    timeZone='Asia/Kolkata'\n).execute()\n```\n\n---\n\n**Action Steps:**\n\n1. Double-check `timeMin` and `timeMax` format.\n2. Ensure all parameters are supported.\n3. If the issue persists, print out the full request being sent for deeper troubleshooting.\n\nIf you share the code (with sensitive info redacted), I can help you debug it further!"

Here\u2019s a breakdown of the issue and how to resolve it:\n\n## **Possible Causes**\n1. **Incorrect Parameters:**  \n   - Some query parameters may be malformed or not allowed by the API.\n2. **Time Formatting Issues:**  \n   - `timeMin` and `timeMax` must be in RFC3339 format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` or with timezone offset).\n3. **Invalid Query String:**  \n   - The `q` or other parameters might be misspecified.\n4. **Misconfigured Timezone:**  \n   - Ensure the `timeZone` key is correctly used and spelled.\n\n## **Diagnosis:**\nYour request URL:\n```\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/primary/events?timeMin=2026-01-06T00%3A00%3A00&timeMax=2026-01-06T23%3A59%3A59&q=meeting&singleEvents=true&orderBy=startTime&timeZone=Asia%2FDhaka&alt=json\n```\n**Potential Issue:**  \n- The `timeMin` and `timeMax` parameters are in `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS` format, but *lack timezone info* (either a `Z` or a timezone offset). The API expects RFC3339, such as `2026-01-06T00:00:00+06:00` or `2026-01-06T00:00:00Z`.\n\n## **How to Fix**\nTry updating your parameters to include the correct timezone offset or `Z` for UTC.\n\n**Example (Dhaka is UTC+6):**\n```\ntimeMin=2026-01-06T00:00:00+06:00\ntimeMax=2026-01-06T23:59:59+06:00\n```\nor, for UTC:\n```\ntimeMin=2026-01-05T18:00:00Z\ntimeMax=2026-01-06T17:59:59Z\n```\n\n## **Final Example Request**\n```\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/primary/events?timeMin=2026-01-06T00:00:00%2B06:00&timeMax=2026-01-06T23:59:59%2B06:00&q=meeting&singleEvents=true&orderBy=startTime&timeZone=Asia%2FDhaka&alt=json\n```\n\n**Tip:**  \nIf you\u2019re constructing the URL programmatically, be sure to properly URL-encode the `'+'` as `%2B`.\n\n## **Other Checks**\n- If the above doesn\u2019t resolve, try removing parameters one by one to isolate which is causing the issue.\n- Ensure that your API credentials are valid and properly authorized.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need help with specific code for this fix!"

Details: \"[{'domain': 'global', 'reason': 'badRequest', 'message': 'Bad Request'}]\">\n```\n\nindicates that there was a **400 Bad Request** error when communicating with the Google Calendar API. Here are **possible reasons and solutions**:\n\n---\n\n### **Common Causes & Solutions**\n\n#### 1. **Date/Time Format Issue**\n- **timeMin** and **timeMax** must be in **RFC3339** format, like `2026-01-06T00:00:00Z` (note the \"Z\" for UTC or an offset, e.g., `+05:30` for Asia/Kolkata).\n- If you use `&timeZone=Asia/Kolkata` parameter, you can set local time, but the time value itself (unless UTC) may create issues.\n- **Fix:**  \n    Change  \n    `2026-01-06T00%3A00%3A00` \u2192 `2026-01-06T00:00:00+05:30`\n    `2026-01-06T23%3A59%3A59` \u2192 `2026-01-06T23:59:59+05:30`\n\n#### 2. **Invalid Parameter**\n- Double-check all parameter names and values.\n- **q=meeting** is fine, but make sure the rest of the parameters are correct.\n\n#### 3. **API Key or Authentication**\n- Make sure your API credentials are valid.\n\n#### 4. **Calendar Access**\n- If you try accessing a calendar where you don't have permission, you'll get errors, but they\u2019re usually **403** not **400**.\n\n#### 5. **Escaping**\n- Make sure all your query parameters are properly URL-encoded.\n\n---\n\n### **Example of Correct API Call**\n\nHere's an example of how a correct request should look:\n```http\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/primary/events?\ntimeMin=2026-01-06T00:00:00%2B05:30&\ntimeMax=2026-01-06T23:59:59%2B05:30&\nq=meeting&\nsingleEvents=true&\norderBy=startTime&\ntimeZone=Asia/Kolkata\n```\nNote the `%2B05:30` is the encoded `+05:30`.\n\n---\n\n### **What You Should Do**\n- Replace the `T00%3A00%3A00` with `T00:00:00%2B05:30` and similarly for `T23:59:59`.\n- Or append a proper \"Z\" or offset for UTC/Kolkata.\n\nIf you can share the **full URL you are using** (hide credentials, of course), I can help spot the problem. \n\n**Let me know if you want a code example (Python, etc.) for doing this!**"

Details: \"[{'domain': 'global', 'reason': 'badRequest', 'message': 'Bad Request'}]\">\n```\n\nmeans that your request to the Google Calendar API was malformed or had invalid parameters. Let\u2019s diagnose possible causes for a **400 Bad Request** error with this endpoint:\n\n---\n\n**Possible Issues & Solutions:**\n\n### 1. **Date and Time Format**\n- `timeMin` and `timeMax` should be in RFC3339 format, e.g., `\"2026-01-06T00:00:00+06:00\"` for Asia/Dhaka. Simply using `\"2026-01-06T00:00:00\"` may default to UTC and/or be missing required timezone info.\n\n**Fix:**  \nAppend the timezone offset or use `Z` for UTC, or pass the `timeZone` parameter correctly.\n\nExample:\n```json\n\"timeMin\": \"2026-01-06T00:00:00+06:00\",\n\"timeMax\": \"2026-01-06T23:59:59+06:00\",\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Incorrect Query Parameter**\n- Google Calendar API expects a timezone offset in the date-time strings, even if you set a `timeZone` parameter.\n\n**Fix:**  \nEnsure your times (in `timeMin` and `timeMax`) always include the timezone offset or use UTC (`Z`) consistently.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Calendar ID**\n- The calendar ID `'primary'` is usually valid, but double-check authentication/scopes if the user is not authorized.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Parameter Typos or Value Issues**\n- Confirm all parameter names and their values match the API\u2019s expectations.\n\n---\n\n## **Corrected Example Request**\n\n```http\nGET https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/primary/events?timeMin=2026-01-06T00:00:00%2B06:00&timeMax=2026-01-06T23:59:59%2B06:00&q=meeting&singleEvents=true&orderBy=startTime&timeZone=Asia%2FDhaka&alt=json\n```\n\nNote that `%2B06:00` is the encoded version of `+06:00`.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Checklist**\n- [ ] Dates in RFC3339 format with timezone offset.\n- [ ] All parameters spell-checked.\n- [ ] Calendar ID and authentication valid.\n- [ ] Testing with minimum parameters (omit optional ones one-by-one to test).\n- [ ] API access not restricted by Google Workspace admin policies.\n\n---\n\n**If you\u2019d like, paste your request code (Python/snippet/cURL), and I\u2019ll help you fix it specifically!**"
