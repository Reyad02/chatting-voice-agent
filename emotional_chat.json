Working a lot can really drain you\u2014physically and mentally.\n\nRight now, what feels most \u201cnot good\u201d: are you exhausted, stressed/anxious, overwhelmed, or feeling sick?\n\nIf you can, try a quick reset (2\u20133 minutes):\n- Drink some water and eat something small if you haven\u2019t.\n- Unclench your jaw/shoulders and take 5 slow breaths (in 4 seconds, out 6 seconds).\n- If possible, step away from screens/noise for a minute.\n\nAnd if you tell me what your workday looked like and what symptoms you\u2019re feeling, I can help you figure out what might help next. If you\u2019re feeling severely unwell (chest pain, trouble breathing, fainting), please get urgent medical help right away."
